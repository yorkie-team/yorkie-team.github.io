## Minikube Installation

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.

In this guide, you will install Yorkie cluster on minikube using Helm.
Then, you will test Yorkie cluster with Quill Example to see how collaborative editing works with Yorkie.

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with Kubernetes and `kubectl`.

For this tutorial, you will need:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.2.40+.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) v3.0+.
- [istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#download) v1.17+.
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) v1.30+ installed on your machine.

### Setup minikube on your machine

First, you need to setup minikube on your machine to use Kubernetes locally and deploy Yorkie cluster.

Start Minikube with the following command:

```bash
$ minikube start
```

After Minikube is started, you will see the following output:

```bash
...
üîé  Verifying Kubernetes components...
üåü  Enabled addons: default-storageclass, storage-provisioner
üèÑ  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

Then, you need to enable ingress addons to expose Yorkie cluster with
[nginx ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/).

Enable ingress addons with the following command:

```bash
$ minikube addons enable ingress
```

After ingress addons are enabled, you will see the following output:

```bash
...
üîé  Verifying ingress addon...
üåü  The 'ingress' addon is enabled
```

### Install Istio with istioctl

After Minikube is configured, you need to install Istio for Yorkie cluster.
Yorkie cluster uses Istio for L7 load balancing and traffic management.

First, create the `yorkie` namespace with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace yorkie
```

Then, install Istio with the following command:

```bash
$ istioctl install -f <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/main/build/charts/yorkie-cluster/istio-operator.yaml)
```

This will install Istio with [Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/) configuration file.
You can find the configuration file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/main/build/charts/yorkie-cluster/istio-operator.yaml).

When installing Istio, you will see the following output:

```bash
This will install the Istio 1.17.1 default profile with ["Istio core" "Istiod" "Ingress gateways"] components into the cluster. Proceed? (y/N)
```

Type `y` and press `Enter` to continue.

After Istio is installed, you will see the following output:

```bash
‚úî Istio core installed
‚úî Istiod installed
‚úî Ingress gateways installed
‚úî Installation complete                                                                                             
Making this installation the default for injection and validation.

Thank you for installing Istio 1.17.  Please take a few minutes to tell us about your install/upgrade experience!  https://forms.gle/hMHGiwZHPU7UQRWe9
```

### Setup MongoDB pod and service

Before installing the Yorkie cluster with Helm chart, you need to set up a MongoDB pod and expose it as a service. This is crucial since internal MongoDB installation is no longer provided.

First, create the `mongodb` namespace with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace mongodb
```

Then, create a MongoDB pod named `mongodb` in the `mongodb` namespace with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl run mongodb --image=mongo:latest --port=27017 -n mongodb
```

Next, expose the MongoDB pod as a service to allow other pods to access it with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl expose pod mongodb --port=27017 --target-port=27017 --name=mongodb --type=ClusterIP -n mongodb
```

By following these steps, you ensure that the MongoDB pod is running and accessible to other pods within the cluster.

### Add yorkie-team Helm chart in your local repository

After Istio is installed, you need to add yorkie-team Helm chart repository in your local repository to install Yorkie cluster.

Add yorkie-team Helm chart repository in your local repository with the following command:

```bash
$ helm repo add yorkie-team https://yorkie-team.github.io/yorkie/helm-charts
```

Then, update your local repository with the following command:

```bash
$ helm repo update
```

### Install Yorkie cluster with Helm chart

Now you have added yorkie-team Helm chart repository in your local repository, you can install Yorkie cluster with Helm chart.

Install Yorkie cluster with the following command:

```bash
$ helm install yorkie-cluster yorkie-team/yorkie-cluster
```

This will install `yorkie-cluster` release in minikube cluster.

<Alert status="info">You can also set other Helm chart configuration options. For more information about Helm chart configuration, see [Yorkie Cluster Helm Chart Configuration](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/tree/main/build/charts/yorkie-cluster#configuration).</Alert>

After Yorkie cluster is installed, you will see the following output:

```bash
NAME: yorkie-cluster
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Apr 27 21:49:06 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
--- Install Complete ---
yorkie-cluster successfully installed!

For next steps, follow:
  $ curl https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/tree/main/charts/yorkie-cluster

To learn more about the release, try:
  $ helm status yorkie-cluster
  $ helm get all yorkie-cluster
```

Now you have Yorkie cluster installed on your local machine.

It will take a few minutes for pods to be ready, so wait until all pods are ready.
You can check the status of pods with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n yorkie --watch
```

After all pods are ready, you will see the following output:

```
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
yorkie-f595554db-48s9c           1/1     Running   0          8m18s
yorkie-f595554db-nggr9           1/1     Running   0          8m18s
yorkie-f595554db-z5jgs           1/1     Running   0          8m18s
yorkie-gateway-844d8c87d-fqpsk   1/1     Running   0          9m55s
```

### Expose Yorkie cluster with Minikube tunnel

After you have installed Yorkie cluster, you need to expose Yorkie cluster with Minikube tunnel to access Yorkie cluster from your local machine.

Expose Yorkie cluster with Minikube tunnel with the following command:

```bash
$ minikube tunnel
```

When Minikube tunnel is started, you will see the following output:

```bash
‚úÖ  Tunnel successfully started

üìå  NOTE: Please do not close this terminal as this process must stay alive for the tunnel to be accessible ...

‚ùó  The service/ingress yorkie requires privileged ports to be exposed: [80 443]
üîë  sudo permission will be asked for it.
üèÉ  Starting tunnel for service yorkie.
Password:
```

Enter your password and press `Enter` to continue.

<Alert status="warning">You need to keep Minikube tunnel running while you are using Yorkie cluster.</Alert>

This will expose Yorkie cluster via minikube cluster's IP address.
You can check the IP address with the following command:

```bash
$ minikube ip
```

### Test Yorkie cluster

Now that you have Yorkie cluster installed and exposed, you can test Yorkie cluster with [yorkie-js-sdk](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk), a JavaScript SDK for Yorkie.

Clone yorkie-js-sdk repository with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk
```

Then, change directory to yorkie-js-sdk folder and install dependencies with the following command:

```bash
$ cd yorkie-js-sdk
$ pnpm i
```

After dependencies are installed, you need to set `VITE_YORKIE_API_ADDR` in the `.env` file to your minikube IP address with the following command:

```bash
$ cd examples/vanilla-quill
$ vi .env

VITE_YORKIE_API_ADDR=http://<minikube-ip>
# If you are using macOS, you should set VITE_YORKIE_API_ADDR to localhost instead of minikube-ip.
# VITE_YORKIE_API_ADDR=http://localhost
```

<Alert status="warning">If you are using macOS, you should set `VITE_YORKIE_API_ADDR` to `localhost` instead of `minikube ip`.</Alert>

Then, start Quill Example with the following command:

```bash
$ cd ../..
$ pnpm vanilla-quill dev

> yorkie-js@0.0.0 vanilla-quill /yorkie-js-sdk
> pnpm --filter=vanilla-quill "dev"


> vanilla-quill@0.0.0 dev /yorkie-js-sdk/examples/vanilla-quill
> vite


  VITE v5.3.5  ready in 178 ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
  ‚ûú  press h + enter to show help
```

You can open several web browsers and access `http://localhost:5173` to test collaborative editing with Quill.

For more examples of collaborative tools developed with Yorkie, including Quill, take a look at [yorkie-js-sdk examples](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/tree/main/examples#examples).

### Clean up Yorkie cluster

You have now installed Yorkie cluster on your local machine, and tested collaborative editing with Quill.

<Alert status="info">To learn about how to configure Yorkie Cluster in Helm Chart, see [Yorkie Cluster Helm Chart Repository](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/tree/main/build/charts/yorkie-cluster).</Alert>

First, stop Quill Example and remove repository folder with the following command:
Use `Ctrl + C` to stop Quill Example.
