## Internals

This section explains how Yorkie works under the hood and how to deploy it at scale. These topics are for those who want a deeper understanding of Yorkie's CRDT engine, synchronization mechanisms, and production infrastructure.

### Topics

- **[CRDT Concepts](/docs/internals/crdt-concepts)**: Understand how Yorkie uses CRDTs for conflict-free collaboration, including data structure hierarchy, logical clocks, elements, nodes, tombstones, and garbage collection
- **[Synchronization](/docs/internals/synchronization)**: Learn how Yorkie keeps document replicas consistent through sync modes, PushPullChanges, checkpoints, snapshots, and the watch stream
- **[Document Lifecycle](/docs/internals/document-lifecycle)**: Understand the state transitions of documents and clients, from attachment through detachment and removal
- **[YSON](/docs/internals/yson)**: Learn about Yorkie Structured Object Notation, the data format used to represent documents with specialized types for collaborative editing
- **[Cluster Mode](/docs/internals/cluster-mode)**: Deploy Yorkie in production with sharded cluster mode, consistent hashing, leader election, and MongoDB sharding
