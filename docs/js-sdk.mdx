## JS SDK

Through Yorkie JS SDK, you can efficiently build collaborative applications. On the client-side implementation, you can create Documents that are automatically synced with remote peers with minimal effort.

If you want to install the SDK, refer to the [Getting Started with JS SDK](/docs/getting-started/with-js-sdk).

### Client

`Client` is a normal client that can communicate with the server. It has documents and sends changes of the document from local to the server to synchronize with other replicas in remote.

#### Creating a Client

We can create a Client using `new yorkie.Client()`. After the Client has been activated, it is connected to the server and ready to use.

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
});
await client.activate();
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### Subscribing to Client events

We can use `client.subscribe` to subscribe to client-based events, such as `status-changed`, `stream-connection-status-changed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = client.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'status-changed') {
    console.log(event.value); // 'activated' or 'deactivated'
  } else if (event.type === 'stream-connection-status-changed') {
    console.log(event.value); // 'connected' or 'disconnected'
  }
});
```

By using the value of the `stream-connection-status-changed` event, it is possible to determine whether the Client is connected to the network.

If you want to know about other client events, please refer to the [ClientEvent](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/yorkie-js-sdk.clientevent), and [ClientEventType](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/yorkie-js-sdk.clienteventtype).

### Document

`Document` is a primary data type in Yorkie, which provides a JSON-like updating experience that makes it easy to represent your application's model.
A `Document` can be updated without being attached to the client, and its changes are automatically propagated to other clients when the `Document` is attached to the `Client` or when the network is restored.

#### Creating a Document

We can create a Document using `yorkie.Document()`. Let's create a Document with a key and attach it to the Client.

```javascript
const doc = new yorkie.Document('doc-1');
```

> The document key is used to identify the Document in Yorkie. It is a string that can be freely defined by the user.
> However, it is allowed to use only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~` and must be less than 120 characters.


#### Attaching the Document

When you attach, the client notifies the server that it is subscribing to this document.
If the document does not exist on the server, it will be created, and any local changes that occurred will be updated to the server's document.
If the server already has a document associated with the provided key, it sends the existing changes to the client, which are then applied to synchronize the document.

Once attached, the document becomes synchronized with other clients.
This ensures that any modifications made by one client are instantly propagated to other clients collaborating on the same document.

The second argument is options.
- `initialPresence`: Sets the initial presence of the client that attaches the document. The presence is shared with other users participating in the document. It must be serializable to JSON.
- `isRealtimeSync`(Optional): Specifies whether to enable real-time synchronization. The default value is `true`, which means synchronization occurs automatically. If set to `false`, you should manually control the synchronization.

```javascript
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialPresence: { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
  isRealtimeSync: true,
});
```

#### Updating presence

The `Document.update()` method allows you to update the presence of the current user.
You only need to provide the specific properties that you want to change.
The existing presence object will be updated by merging the new changes, and any properties not specified in the update function will remain unchanged.

```javascript
doc.update((root, presence) => {
  presence.set({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } });
});
```

#### Getting presence 

##### Document.getPresence(clientID) 

It returns the presence of a specific client.

```javascript
doc.getPresence(client.getID()); // { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }
```

##### Document.getMyPresence() 

 It returns the presence of the current client that has attached to the document.

```javascript
doc.getMyPresence(); // { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }
```

##### Document.getPresences() 

It returns an array about all clients currently participating in the document.
Each entry in the array includes the client's id and presence.

```javascript
const users = doc.getPresences();
for (const { clientID, presence } of users ) {
  // Do something
}
```

#### Displaying users

Here is an example of showing a list of users participating in the collaborative application.
- [Profile Stack](/examples/profile-stack)

##### Document.subscribe("presence")

This method allows you to subscribe to all presence-related changes.
By subscribing to these events, you can be notified when specific changes occur within the document, such as clients attaching, detaching, or modifying their presence.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe("presence", (event) => {
  if (event.type === "initialized") {
    // Array of other users currently participating in the document
    // event.value;
  }

  if (event.type === "watched") {
    // A user has joined the document editing in online
    // event.value;
  }

  if (event.type === "unwatched") {
    // A user has left the document editing
    // event.value;
  }

  if (event.type === "presence-changed") {
    // A user has updated their presence 
    // event.value;
  }
});
```

##### Document.subscribe("my-presence")

This method is specifically for subscribing to changes in the presence of the current client that has attached to the document.

The possible event.type are: `initialized`, `presence-changed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe("my-presence", (event) => {
  // Do something
});
```

##### Document.subscribe("others")

This method enables you to subscribe to changes in the presence of other clients participating in the document.

The possible event.type are: `watched`, `unwatched`, `presence-changed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe("others", (event) => {
  if (event.type === "watched") {
    addUser(event.value);
  }

  if (event.type === "unwatched") {
    removeUser(event.value);
  }

  if (event.type === "presence-changed") {
    updateUser(event.value);
  }
});
```

#### Editing the Document

`Document.update(changeFn, message)` enables you to modify a Document. The optional `message` allows you to add a description to the change. If the Document is attached to the Client, all changes are automatically synchronized with other Clients.

```javascript
const message = 'update document for test';
doc.update((root) => {
  root.todos = [];
  root.todos.push('todo-1');
  root.obj = {
    name: 'yorkie',
    age: 14,
  };
  root.counter = new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 0);
  root.counter.increase(1);
}, message);
```

Under the hood, `root` in the `update` function creates a `change`, a set of operations, using a JavaScript proxy. Every element has its unique ID, created by the logical clock. This ID is used by Yorkie to track which object is which.

You can get the contents of the Document using `document.getRoot()`.

```javascript
const root = doc.getRoot();
console.log(root.todos);    // ["todo-1"]
console.log(root.obj);      // {"name":"yorkie","age":14}
console.log(root.obj.name); // "yorkie"
console.log(root.counter.getValue()); // 1
```

#### Subscribing to Document

##### Document.subscribe()

A Document can be modified by changes generated remotely or locally in Yorkie.

Whenever the Document is modified, change events are triggered and we can subscribe to these events using the `document.subscribe(callback)`.

The callback is called with an event object, and the `event.type` property indicates the source of the change, which can be one of the following values: `local-change`, `remote-change`, or `snapshot`.

When the `event.type` is `local-change` or `remote-change`, the `event.value` is a changeInfo, which has `{operations, message}` properties.

For more information about changeInfo for document events, please refer to the [ChangeInfo](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/yorkie-js-sdk.remotechangeevent.html).


```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'local-change') {
    console.log(event);
  } else if (event.type === 'remote-change') {
    // `message` delivered when calling document.update
    const { message, operations } = event.value;    
    
    for (const op of operations) {
      // ex) { type: 'increase', value: 1, path: '$.counter' }
      switch (op.type) {
        case 'increase':
          // Do something...
          break;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

##### Document.subscribe("$.path")

Additionally, you can subscribe to changes for a specific path in the Document using `doc.subscribe(path, callback)` with a path argument, such as `$.todos`, where the `$` sign indicates the root of the document.
The callback function is called when the target path and its nested values are changed.

With this feature, you can easily subscribe to changes for a specific part of the document and perform different actions based on the updated values.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('$.todos', (event) => { 
  // The callback will be called when the root.todos or any of its nested values change.
  const target = doc.getValueByPath('$.todos') // you can get the value by path 
  // Do something...
});
```

#### Changing Syncronization Setting

To change the synchronization setting for a document, you can use `client.pause(doc)` and `client.resume(doc)`.

When you pause a document, the synchronization process will no longer occur in realtime, and you will need to manually execute the synchronization to ensure that the changes are propagated to other clients.

To resume the realtime synchronization, you can call `client.resume(doc)`.

```javascript
// 1. Pause real-time sync
await client.pause(doc);
await client.sync(doc); // To perform synchronization, you need to manually call the sync function

// 2. Resume real-time sync
await client.resume(doc);
```

#### Changing Syncronization Mode

By default, Yorkie synchronizes a document in `push-pull` mode, where local changes are pushed to the server, and remote changes are pulled from the server.

If you only want to send your changes and not receive remote changes, you can use `push-only` mode.

For realtime synchronization, you can use `client.pauseRemoteChanges(doc)` and `client.resumeRemoteChanges(doc)`.

For manual synchronization, you can pass the desired sync mode to `client.sync(doc, syncMode)`.

```javascript
// Pause remote changes for realtime sync
client.pauseRemoteChanges(doc);
// Resume remote changes for realtime sync
client.resumeRemoteChanges(doc);

// Manual sync in Push-Only mode
await client.sync(doc, SyncMode.PushOnly);
// Manual sync in Push-Pull mode
await client.sync(doc, SyncMode.PushPull);
```

#### Detaching the Document

If the document is no longer used, it should be detached to increase the efficiency of GC removing [CRDT tombstones](https://crdt.tech/glossary). For more information about GC, please refer to [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

```javascript
await client.detach(doc);
```

### Custom CRDT types

Custom CRDT types are data types that can be used for special applications such as text editors and counters, unlike general JSON data types such as `Object` and `Array`. Custom CRDT types can be created in the callback function of `document.update`.

#### Text

`Text` provides supports for collaborative text editing. In addition, contents in `Text` can have attributes; for example, characters can be bold, italic, or underlined.

```javascript
doc.update((root) => {
  root.text = new yorkie.Text();            // {"text":""}
  root.text.edit(0, 0, 'hello');            // {"text":"hello"}
  root.text.edit(0, 1, 'H');                // {"text":"Hello"}
  root.text.setStyle(0, 1, { bold: true }); // {"text":"<b>H</b>ello"}
});
```

##### Selection using presence

The temporary client information, such as text selection, does not need to be stored in the document permanently.
Instead, it can be effectively shared using `presence`.

When transmitting text selection information, it is essential to convert the `index`, which can vary based on the text state, into the `position` used by `Yorkie.Text`.
This converted position selection can then be sent and applied through presence.

Here is an example where presence is used to share text selection between users in CodeMirror editor.

- When the text selection is changed:

```javascript
// Update selection through text editing
codemirror.on('beforeChange', (cm, change) => {
  doc.update((root, presence) => {
    const range = root.content.edit(from, to, content); // return updated index range
    presence.set({
      selection: root.content.indexRangeToPosRange(range), // update presence
    });
  });
});

// Update selection using mouse or keyboard
codemirror.on('beforeSelectionChange', (cm, change) => {
  const fromIdx = cm.indexFromPos(change.ranges[0].anchor);
  const toIdx = cm.indexFromPos(change.ranges[0].head);
  doc.update((root, presence) => {
    presence.set({
      selection: root.content.indexRangeToPosRange([fromIdx, toIdx]), // update presence
    });
  });
});
```

- When applying other user's selection changes:

```javascript
doc.subscribe('others', (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {
    const { clientID, presence } = event.value;
    const range = doc.getRoot().content.posRangeToIndexRange(presence.selection);
    // Handle the updated selection in the editor
  }
});
```

Text selection can be efficiently shared using presence.
Please refer to the following example for a complete code:

- An example of Text co-editing with CodeMirror: [CodeMirror example](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/blob/main/examples/vanilla-codemirror6)
- An example of Text co-editing with Quill: [Quill example](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/blob/main/examples/vanilla-quill)

#### Counter

`Counter` supports integer types changing with addition and subtraction. If an integer data needs to be modified simultaneously, `Counter` should be used instead of primitives.

```javascript
doc.update((root) => {
  root.counter = new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 1); // {"counter":1}
  root.counter.increase(2);                             // {"counter":3}
  root.counter.increase(3);                             // {"counter":6}
  root.counter.increase(-4);                            // {"counter":2}
});
```

### TypeScript Support

To use the Document more strictly, we can use [type variable](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) in TypeScript when creating a Document.

```typescript
import yorkie, { JSONArray } from 'yorkie-js-sdk';
type DocType = {
  list: JSONArray<number>;
  text: yorkie.Text;
};
type PresenceType = {
  username: string;
  color: string;
};

const doc = new yorkie.Document<DocType, PresenceType>('key');
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialPresence: {
    username: 'alice',
    color: 'blue',
  },
});
doc.update((root, presence) => {
  root.list = [1, 2, 3];
  root.text = new yorkie.Text();
  presence.set({ color: 'red' });
});
```
