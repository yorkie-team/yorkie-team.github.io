## JS SDK

Through Yorkie JS SDK, you can efficiently build collaborative applications. On the client-side implementation, you can create Documents that are automatically synced with remote peers with minimal effort.

If you want to install the SDK, refer to the [Getting Started with JS SDK](/docs/getting-started/with-js-sdk).

### Client

`Client` is a regular client that communicates with the server. It has documents and sends local changes to the server to synchronize with other replicas remotely.

#### Creating a Client

You can create a Client using `new yorkie.Client()`. After the Client has been activated, it is connected to the server and ready to use.

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
});
await client.activate();
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

##### Creating a Client with Auth Token

You can configure authentication for the client by setting up an `authTokenInjector` to provide tokens for Auth Webhook verification.
If a `codes.Unauthenticated` error occurs, the `authTokenInjector` will be called again with the webhook's response reason, enabling automatic token refresh.
For more information about `Auth Webhook`, please refer to the [Auth Webhook](/docs/auth-webhook).

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  authTokenInjector: async (reason) => {
    // Handle token refresh logic based on webhook response
    if (reason === 'token expired') {
      return await refreshAccessToken();
    }
    return accessToken;
  },
});
```

##### Measuring MAU

You can measure MAU(Monthly Active Users) by setting the `userID` metadata when creating a client. The `userID` should be a unique identifier for each user.

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  metadata: { userID: 'user-1234' },
});
```

You can check the MAU in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}) by selecting the project and clicking the `overview` tab.

##### Deactivate the Client

When the client is no longer needed, you can deactivate it to release resources and disconnect from the server.

```javascript
await client.deactivate();
```

This will detach all documents attached to the client for efficient [garbage collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

> When the page is closed, the client should be deactivated for proper cleanup. For this, you can use the `beforeunload` event.
> Using the `keepalive` option in `deactivate` request will remain open, even if the page that initiated the request is closed.
> 
> ```javascript
> window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
>   client.deactivate({keepalive: true});
> });
> ```
> For more information about `keepalive`, please refer to the https://css-tricks.com/send-an-http-request-on-page-exit/.

### Document

`Document` is a primary data type in Yorkie, which provides a JSON-like updating experience that makes it easy to represent your application's model.
A `Document` can be updated without being attached to the client, and its changes are automatically propagated to other clients when the `Document` is attached to the `Client` or when the network is restored.

#### Creating a Document

You can create a Document using `yorkie.Document()`. Let's create a Document with a key and attach it to the Client.

```javascript
const doc = new yorkie.Document('doc-1');
```

> The document key is used to identify the Document in Yorkie. It is a string that can be freely defined by the user.
> However, it is allowed to use only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~` and must be less than 120 characters.


#### Attaching the Document

When you attach, the client notifies the server that it is subscribing to this document.
If the document does not exist on the server, it will be created, and any local changes that occurred will be updated to the server's document.
If the server already has a document associated with the provided key, it sends the existing changes to the client, which are then applied to synchronize the document.

Once attached, the document becomes synchronized with other clients.
This ensures that any modifications made by one client are instantly propagated to other clients collaborating on the same document.

The second argument is options.
- `initialPresence`: Sets the initial presence of the client that attaches the document. The presence is shared with other users participating in the document. It must be serializable to JSON.
- `syncMode`(Optional): Specifies synchronization modes. The default value is `SyncMode.Realtime`, which automatically pushes and pulls changes. If you set it to `SyncMode.Manual`, you'll need to manually handle synchronization.

```javascript
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialPresence: { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } },
  syncMode: SyncMode.Manual,
});
```

#### Initializing root

The root is used to manage the application's data, such as primitives, arrays, Counters, and Text in a form within the `Document`. You can set the initial values when calling `Document.attach()` using the `initialRoot` option.

```javascript
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialRoot: {
    list: [1, 2, 3],
    counter: new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 0),
  },
});
```

The initial values are partially applied. For each element in `initialRoot`:
- If the key doesn't exist, the element will be applied.
- If the key already exists in the Document, that element will be discarded. Users don't need to worry about overwriting existing valid counters.

```javascript
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialRoot: {
    list: [],
  },
});

// Another client tries to attach with initialRoot option:
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialRoot: {
    list: [1, 2, 3],    // this update will be discarded
    counter: new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 0), // this update will be applied
  },
});

// final state
// root = {
//   list: [],
//   counter: {}
// }
```

We support element types for Primitives, and [Custom CRDT types](/docs/js-sdk/#custom-crdt-types/).

<Alert status="warning">
Elements added by `initialRoot` are not sent to the server during the `attach` process. They are applied locally to the Document after push-pull during `attach`.
</Alert>

#### Updating presence

The `Document.update()` method allows you to make changes to the state of the current user's presence.

Specific properties provided will be changed. The existing presence object will be updated by merging the new changes. In other words, properties not specified in the update function will remain unchanged. 

```javascript
doc.update((root, presence) => {
  presence.set({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } });
});

// final state
// presence = { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }
// we can see that the changes made were merged and the final state of the current user's presence is as we desire
```

<Alert status="warning">
Note, the properties provided will be replaced entirely and not merely updated.

For example:

```javascript
await client.attach(doc, {
  // let's say 'color' is a property of cursor
  initialPresence: {cursor: { x: 0, y: 0, color: 'red'}}, 
});

doc.update((root, presence) => {
  // we want to change the x y coordinates of our cursor
  presence.set({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }); 
});

// final state
// presence = { cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } } 
// we can see that all properties inside cursor get replaced (i.e. we lose the property 'color')
```
</Alert>

#### Getting presence 

You can get the presences of the current client and other clients participating in the document.

##### Document.getPresence(clientID) 

It returns the presence of a specific client.

```javascript
doc.getPresence(client.getID()); // { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }
```

##### Document.getMyPresence() 

 It returns the presence of the current client that has attached to the document.

```javascript
doc.getMyPresence(); // { color: 'blue', cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }
```

##### Document.getPresences() 

It returns an array about all clients currently participating in the document.
Each entry in the array includes the client's id and presence.

```javascript
const users = doc.getPresences();
for (const { clientID, presence } of users ) {
  // Do something
}
```

Here is an example of showing a list of users participating in the collaborative application.
- [Profile Stack](/examples/profile-stack)

##### Document.subscribe('presence')

This method allows you to subscribe to presence-related changes. You'll be notified whenever clients watch, unwatch, or modify their presence.

The `initialized` event occurs when the client list needs to be initialized.
For example, this happens when you first connect a watch stream to a document, when the connection is lost, or when it is reconnected.

<Alert status="warning">
Subscribe before attaching the document to ensure you receive the initial `initialized` event.
</Alert>

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('presence', (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'initialized') {
    // event.value: Array of users currently participating in the document
  }

  if (event.type === 'watched') {
    // event.value: A user has joined the document editing in online
  }

  if (event.type === 'unwatched') {
    // event.value: A user has left the document editing
  }

  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {
    // event.value: A user has updated their presence
  }
});
```

Use `my-presence` and `others` topics to distinguish between your own events and those of others.

##### Document.subscribe('my-presence')

This method is specifically for subscribing to changes in the presence of the current client that has attached to the document.

The possible event.type are: `initialized`, `presence-changed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('my-presence', (event) => {
  // Do something
});
```

##### Document.subscribe('others')

This method enables you to subscribe to changes in the presence of other clients participating in the document.

The possible event.type are: `watched`, `unwatched`, `presence-changed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('others', (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'watched') {
    addUser(event.value);
  }

  if (event.type === 'unwatched') {
    removeUser(event.value);
  }

  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {
    updateUser(event.value);
  }
});
```

#### Editing the Document

`Document.update(changeFn, message)` enables you to modify a Document. The optional `message` allows you to add a description to the change. If the Document is attached to the Client, all changes are automatically synchronized with other Clients.

```javascript
const message = 'update document for test';
doc.update((root) => {
  root.todos = [];
  root.todos.push('todo-1');
  root.obj = {
    name: 'yorkie',
    age: 14,
  };
  root.counter = new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 0);
  root.counter.increase(1);
}, message);
```

Under the hood, `root` in the `update` function creates a `change`, a set of operations, using a JavaScript proxy. Every element has its unique ID, created by the logical clock. This ID is used by Yorkie to track which object is which.

You can get the contents of the Document using `document.getRoot()`.

```javascript
const root = doc.getRoot();
console.log(root.todos);    // ["todo-1"]
console.log(root.obj);      // {"name":"yorkie","age":14}
console.log(root.obj.name); // "yorkie"
console.log(root.counter.getValue()); // 1
```

#### Subscribing to Document

You can subscribe to various events occurring in the Document, such as changes, connection status, synchronization status, and all events by using the `document.subscribe()` method.
By subscribing to these events, you can update the UI in real-time and handle exceptions that may occur during synchronization.

##### Document.subscribe()

A Document can be modified by changes generated remotely or locally in Yorkie. Whenever the Document is modified, change events are triggered and you can subscribe to these events using the `document.subscribe(callback)` method.
By subscribing to changes in the Document, you can receive updates in real-time, which is useful for updating the UI when the Document changes.

The callback is called with an event object, and the `event.type` property indicates the source of the change, which can be one of the following values: `local-change`, `remote-change`, or `snapshot`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === 'snapshot') {
    // `snapshot` delivered when the entire document is updated from the server.
  } else if (event.type === 'local-change') {
    // `local-change` delivered when calling document.update from the current client.
  } else if (event.type === 'remote-change') {
    // `remote-change` delivered when the document is updated from other clients.
    const { message, operations } = event.value;
    
    // You can access the operations that have been applied to the document.
    for (const op of operations) {
      // e.g.) { type: 'increase', value: 1, path: '$.counter' }
      switch (op.type) {
        case 'increase':
          // ...
          break;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

When the `event.type` is `local-change` or `remote-change`, the `event.value` is a changeInfo, which has `{operations, message}` properties.
For more information about changeInfo for document events, please refer to the [ChangeInfo](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/interfaces/ChangeInfo.html).

<Alert status="warning">
The `event.rawChange` value for `local-change` and `remote-change` events, and the `event.value.snapshot` for `snapshot` event, are set only when [`enableDevtools`](/docs/devtools/#install-the-extension) option is configured as `true`.
</Alert>

The `snapshot` event is triggered when a snapshot is received from the server.
This occurs when the changes that a document needs to fetch from the server exceed a certain `SnapshotThreshold`.
Instead of sending numerous changes, the server sends a snapshot of the document.
In such cases, it is essential to update with data from the Yorkie Document.
Refer to the [example code](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/blob/9c7accdfe337b9c9e7c7d0d3b3acc335951866ce/public/index.html#L346-L350) for handling snapshots in CodeMirror.

<Alert status="warning">
If a client has not synchronized for a prolonged period and then makes a sync request, it might receive a `snapshot` event.
Ensure your application processes these snapshot events correctly to maintain document synchronization.
</Alert>

##### Document.subscribe('$.path')

Additionally, you can subscribe to changes for a specific path in the Document using `doc.subscribe(path, callback)` with a path argument, such as `$.todos`, where the `$` sign indicates the root of the document.
The callback function is called when the target path and its nested values are changed.

With this feature, you can easily subscribe to changes for a specific part of the document and perform different actions based on the updated values.

```javascript
// The event is triggered when the value of the path("$.todos") is changed.
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('$.todos', (event) => { 
  // You can access the updated value of the path.
  const target = doc.getValueByPath('$.todos');
});
```

##### Document.subscribe('connection')

After attaching the document to the client, the document is continuously synchronized with the server in real-time. This is achieved by maintaining a watch stream connection between the client and the server, which allows the client to receive events and updates from other users.

To monitor the connection status of the stream, you can use a callback function that is triggered whenever the connection status changes. The possible values for `event.value` are `StreamConnectionStatus.Connected` and `StreamConnectionStatus.Disconnected`.

When the watch stream is disconnected, it indicates that the user is offline and will not receive real-time updates from other users.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('connection', (event) => {
  if (event.value === StreamConnectionStatus.Connected) {
    // The watch stream is connected.
  } else if (event.value === StreamConnectionStatus.Disconnected) {
    // The watch stream is disconnected.
  }
});
```

For more information about `StreamConnectionStatus`, please refer to the [StreamConnectionStatus](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/enums/StreamConnectionStatus.html).

##### Document.subscribe('sync')

If the document is attached to the client in `SyncMode.Realtime`, the document is automatically synchronized with the server in real-time.
Under this mode, the document executes synchronization in the background, and you can track the synchronization status using the `sync` event. The possible `event.value` values are: `DocumentSyncStatus.Synced` and `DocumentSyncStatus.SyncFailed`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('sync', (event) => {
  if (event.value === DocumentSyncStatus.Synced) {
    // The document is synchronized with the server.
  } else if (event.value === DocumentSyncStatus.SyncFailed) {
    // The document failed to synchronize with the server.
  }
});
```

For more information about `DocumentSyncStatus`, please refer to the [DocumentSyncStatus](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/enums/DocumentSyncStatus.html).

##### Document.subscribe('status')

You can subscribe to the status of the document using `doc.subscribe('status', callback)`. The possible values for `event.value.status` are `DocumentStatus.Attached` and `DocumentStatus.Detached`.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('status', (event) => {
  if (event.value.status === DocumentStatus.Attached) {
    // The document is attached to the client.
  } else if (event.value.status === DocumentStatus.Detached) {
    // The document is detached from the client.
  }
});
```

For more information about `DocumentStatus`, please refer to the [DocumentStatus](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/enums/DocumentStatus.html).

<Alert status="warning">
In Web-based applications, it is hard to detect when the user closes the browser or navigates to another page. In such cases, the document may remain attached to the client, which can lead to unefficient storage and memory usage.
For handle this, Yorkie provides one of housekeeping feature, `client-deactivate-threshold`, which is a time interval to automatically deactivate the clients that have not been used for a certain period.
<br/>
If the client is deactivated due to inactivity, the document will be detached from the client, and you will receive a `DocumentStatus.Detached` event through the `doc.subscribe('status', callback)` method.
<br/>
For more information about `client-deactivate-threshold`, please refer to the [Client Deactivate Threshold](/docs/cli#client-deactivate-threshold).
</Alert>

##### Document.subscribe('auth-error')

You can subscribe to authentication error events using `doc.subscribe('auth-error', callback)`.
This event is triggered when an unauthenticated error occurs during `PushPull` or `WatchDocuments` operations,
specifically when the system automatically refreshes the token and retries the operation.

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('auth-error', (event) => {
  console.log(event.value);
  // event.value contains:
  // - reason: string
  // - method: 'PushPull' | 'WatchDocuments'
});
```

This subscription allows you to monitor when token refreshes occur due to authentication errors.  
For more information about `Auth Webhook`, please refer to the [Auth Webhook](/docs/auth-webhook).

##### Document.subscribe('all')

You can subscribe to all events occurring in the document by using `document.subscribe('all', callback)`. This is used for displaying events in [Devtools extension](/docs/devtools).

Events received from the callback function are of type `TransactionEvent`, which is an `Array<DocEvent>`. TransactionEvent represents a collection of events occurring within a single transaction (e.g., `doc.update()`).

```javascript
const unsubscribe = doc.subscribe('all', (transactionEvent) => {
  for (const docEvent of transactionEvent) {
    console.log(docEvent);
  }
});
```

#### Changing Synchronization Mode

To change the synchronization mode for a document, you can use `client.changeSyncMode(doc, syncMode)`.

Yorkie offers four SyncModes:

- `SyncMode.Realtime`: Local changes are automatically pushed to the server, and remote changes are pulled from the server.

- `SyncMode.RealtimePushOnly`: Only local changes are pushed, and remote changes are not pulled.

- `SyncMode.RealtimeSyncOff`: Changes are not synchronized, but the watch stream remains active.

- `SyncMode.Manual`: Synchronization no longer occurs in real-time, and the watch stream is disconneted. Manual handling is required for synchronization.

```javascript
// Enable automatic synchronization of both local and remote changes.
await client.changeSyncMode(doc, SyncMode.Realtime);

// Only push local changes automatically.
await client.changeSyncMode(doc, SyncMode.RealtimePushOnly);

// Synchronization turned off, but the watch stream remains active.
await client.changeSyncMode(doc, SyncMode.RealtimeSyncOff);

// Synchronization turned off, and the watch stream is disconneted.
await client.changeSyncMode(doc, SyncMode.Manual);
await client.sync(doc); // Trigger synchronization manually using the sync function.
```

#### Detaching the Document

If the document is no longer used, it should be detached to increase the efficiency of GC removing [CRDT tombstones](https://crdt.tech/glossary). For more information about GC, please refer to [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

```javascript
await client.detach(doc);
```

### Custom CRDT types

Custom CRDT types are data types that can be used for special applications such as text editors and counters, unlike general JSON data types such as `Object` and `Array`. Custom CRDT types can be created in the callback function of `document.update`.

#### Text

`Text` provides supports for collaborative text editing. In addition, contents in `Text` can have attributes; for example, characters can be bold, italic, or underlined.

```javascript
doc.update((root) => {
  root.text = new yorkie.Text();            // {"text":""}
  root.text.edit(0, 0, 'hello');            // {"text":"hello"}
  root.text.edit(0, 1, 'H');                // {"text":"Hello"}
  root.text.setStyle(0, 1, { bold: true }); // {"text":"<b>H</b>ello"}
});
```

##### Selection using presence

The temporary client information, such as text selection, does not need to be stored in the document permanently.
Instead, it can be effectively shared using `presence`.

When transmitting text selection information, it is essential to convert the `index`, which can vary based on the text state, into the `position` used by `Yorkie.Text`.
This converted position selection can then be sent and applied through presence.

Here is an example where presence is used to share text selection between users in CodeMirror editor.

- When the text selection is changed:

```javascript
// Update selection through text editing
codemirror.on('beforeChange', (cm, change) => {
  doc.update((root, presence) => {
    const range = root.content.edit(from, to, content); // return updated index range
    presence.set({
      selection: root.content.indexRangeToPosRange(range), // update presence
    });
  });
});

// Update selection using mouse or keyboard
codemirror.on('beforeSelectionChange', (cm, change) => {
  const fromIdx = cm.indexFromPos(change.ranges[0].anchor);
  const toIdx = cm.indexFromPos(change.ranges[0].head);
  doc.update((root, presence) => {
    presence.set({
      selection: root.content.indexRangeToPosRange([fromIdx, toIdx]), // update presence
    });
  });
});
```

- When applying other user's selection changes:

```javascript
doc.subscribe('others', (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'presence-changed') {
    const { clientID, presence } = event.value;
    const range = doc.getRoot().content.posRangeToIndexRange(presence.selection);
    // Handle the updated selection in the editor
  }
});
```

Text selection can be efficiently shared using presence.
Please refer to the following example for a complete code:

- An example of Text co-editing with CodeMirror: [CodeMirror example](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/blob/main/examples/vanilla-codemirror6)
- An example of Text co-editing with Quill: [Quill example](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-js-sdk/blob/main/examples/vanilla-quill)

#### Counter

`Counter` supports integer types changing with addition and subtraction. If an integer data needs to be modified simultaneously, `Counter` should be used instead of primitives.

```javascript
doc.update((root) => {
  root.counter = new yorkie.Counter(yorkie.IntType, 1); // {"counter":1}
  root.counter.increase(2);                             // {"counter":3}
  root.counter.increase(3);                             // {"counter":6}
  root.counter.increase(-4);                            // {"counter":2}
});
```

### TypeScript Support

To use the Document more strictly, you can use [type variable](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) in TypeScript when creating a Document.

```typescript
import yorkie, { JSONArray } from 'yorkie-js-sdk';
type DocType = {
  list: JSONArray<number>;
  text: yorkie.Text;
};
type PresenceType = {
  username: string;
  color: string;
};

const doc = new yorkie.Document<DocType, PresenceType>('key');
await client.attach(doc, {
  initialPresence: {
    username: 'alice',
    color: 'blue',
  },
});
doc.update((root, presence) => {
  root.list = [1, 2, 3];
  root.text = new yorkie.Text();
  presence.set({ color: 'red' });
});
```

### Logger Options

The Logger outputs events occurring within the SDK to the console for debugging purposes. To modify these options, you can use the `setLogLevel` function.

```typescript
import { setLogLevel, LogLevel } from 'yorkie-js-sdk';

setLogLevel(LogLevel.Error); // Display logs with Error or higher
```

The available log levels for `setLogLevel` are:

| LogLevel | Description                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `LogLevel.Trivial`  | Most verbose level, displays all logs    |
| `LogLevel.Debug`    | Detailed information for debugging       |
| `LogLevel.Info`     | General information                      |
| `LogLevel.Warn`     | Warnings and potential issues            |
| `LogLevel.Error`    | Errors and unexpected behavior           |
| `LogLevel.Fatal`    | Critical errors, may lead to termination |

Adjust the log level for flexible control over log verbosity in your application.


### Reference

For details on how to use the JS SDK, please refer to [JS SDK Reference](https://yorkie.dev/yorkie-js-sdk/api-reference/).
