## YSON

YSON(Yorkie Structured Object Notation) is a structured data format used by Yorkie to represent documents. It is similar to JSON but extends it with additional data types optimized for collaborative editing.

### Data Types

YSON supports standard JSON types and adds specialized types for collaborative applications. Each YSON type has specific use cases and representation formats:

| Type | Description | Format Example | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| String | UTF-8 encoded text | `"value1"` | Text content |
| Number | Standard numeric value | `42.5` | Generic numeric values |
| Boolean | True or false | `true` | Flags and boolean states |
| Null | Null value | `null` | Absent or undefined values |
| Object | Collection of key-value pairs | `{"key": "value"}` | Structured data |
| Array | Ordered list of values | `[1, 2, 3]` | Sequential collections |
| Int | 32-bit integer | `Int(42)` | Precise integer values |
| Long | 64-bit integer | `Long(64)` | Large integer values |
| Date | ISO 8601 timestamp | `Date("2025-01-02T15:04:05.058Z")` | Time values |
| BinData | Binary data with Base64 encoding | `BinData("AQID")` | Binary content |
| Counter | Concurrent counter | `Counter(Int(10))` | Collaborative counting |
| Text | List-based Rich Text | `Text({"type":"p",...})` | List-based Rich Text Editor, e.g) Quill |
| Tree | Tree-based Rich Text | `Tree({"type":"p",...})` | Tree-based Rich Text Editor |

### Custom Types Details

#### Int and Long

YSON provides explicit integer types to ensure consistent handling across platforms:

- `Int(number)`: A 32-bit integer type (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- `Long(number)`: A 64-bit integer type for larger numbers

These types help ensure that numeric values are interpreted consistently when sharing documents across different programming languages.

#### Date
YSON Date represents a timestamp value in ISO 8601 format:

```json
Date("2025-01-02T15:04:05.058Z")
```

Dates in YSON are stored as strings in ISO format for consistent representation across systems.

#### BinData
Binary data in YSON is represented using Base64 encoding:

```json
BinData("AQID")  // Base64 encoded binary data
```

This allows binary content to be safely represented and transmitted as text.

#### Counter

`Counter` type is specifically designed for collaborative counting operations where multiple users might modify a numeric value concurrently:

```json
Counter(Int(10))  // A counter with initial value of 10
```

Using Counter instead of a regular number prevents conflicts when multiple users increment or decrement values simultaneously.

#### Text
The Text type is designed for rich text editing, allowing for complex formatting and attributes:

```json
Text([{"val":"Hello","attrs":{"color":"red"}},{"val":"World","attrs":{"color":"blue"}}])
```

This structure allows for a list of text segments, each with its own attributes, enabling rich text editing capabilities.

#### Tree
The Tree type provides a specialized structure for representing hierarchical data, particularly useful for rich text editing:

```json
Tree({"type":"p","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tree in object"}]})
```

This structure allows for a tree-based representation of rich text, where each node can have its own type and attributes.

### Example Document

```json
{
  "str": "value1",        // Standard string
  "num": 42,             // Standard number(float64)
  "int": Int(42),         // 32-bit integer
  "long": Long(64),        // 64-bit integer
  "null": null,            // Standard null
  "bool": true,            // Standard boolean
  "bytes": BinData("AQID"), // Binary data (Base64)
  "date": Date("2025-01-02T15:04:05.058Z"), // Date and time
  "counter": Counter(Int(10)), // Counter with integer value
  "text": Text([{"val":"Hello","attrs":{"color":"red"}},{"val":"World","attrs":{"color":"blue"}}]), // List-based Rich Text
  "tree": Tree({"type":"p","attrs":{"align":"center"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hello World"}]}) // Tree-based Rich Text
}
```
