## Getting Started with iOS SDK

Welcome to Yorkie iOS SDK! In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with the iOS SDK.

### Using in your projects

#### Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Yorkie as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```
dependencies: [
  .Package(url: "https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-ios-sdk.git", from: "{{YORKIE_IOS_VERSION}}")
]
```

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client with API key

```swift
let client = Client("https://{{API_HOST}}", ClientOptions(apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"))
try await client.activate()
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```swift
let doc = Document(key: docKey)
try await client.attach(doc, [:])
```

The document should be attached to the client in order to automatically synchronize it between the users participating the document.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `Document.update()`.

```swift
try await doc.update{ root, _ in
  root.todos = Array<String>()                    // {"todos":[]}
  (root.todos as? JSONArray)?.append("todo-1")    // {"todos":["todo-1"]}
  root.obj = ["name": "yorkie", "age": Int64(14)] // {"obj":{"name":"yorkie","age":14},"todos":["todo-1"]}
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `doc.getRoot()`. Using a dot notation, you can access a key-value property you or your peers have set.

```swift
try await doc.update{ root, _ in
  root.sharedMessage = "Hello World!"
}
await print(self.document.getRoot().sharedMessage!) // "Hello World!"
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document using `doc.subscribe()`.

```swift
await doc.subscribe { event in
  print("A change event occurred in the Document!")
}
```

You can execute different actions depending on the source of change. The source can be accessed from `event.type`.

The value can be: `localChange`, `remoteChange` or `snapshot`.

```swift
await doc.subscribe { event in
  if event.type == .remoteChange {
    print("A peer has changed the Document!")
  }
}
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of users

You can also subscribe to the presence of users participating in the document using `doc.subscribePresence(.presence)`. 
You can use `doc.getPresences()` to get the list of users who are currently involved in the document.

```swift
await doc.subscribePresnece { event in 
  // get all users connected to the Document.
  let users = doc.getPresences() // [ (clientID: string, presence: [key: value]), ... ]
  print("There are currently \(users.count) users online")
}
```

Next, let's take a look at the [iOS SDK](/docs/ios-sdk).
