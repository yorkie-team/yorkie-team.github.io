## Getting Started with iOS SDK

Welcome to Yorkie iOS SDK! In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with the iOS SDK.

### Using in your projects

#### Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Yorkie as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```
dependencies: [
  .Package(url: "https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie-ios-sdk.git", from: "{{YORKIE_IOS_VERSION}}")
]
```

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client with API key

```swift
let client = Client(rpcAddress: RPCAddress(host: "{{API_HOST}}", port: {{API_PORT}}), options: ClientOptions(key: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"))
try await client.activate()
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```swift
let doc = Document(key: docKey)
await client.attach(doc);
```

The created document should be attached to the client to automatically synchronize the document between the client and peers.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `Document.update()`.

```swift
await doc.update { root in
  root.key = "Key value"
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `Document.getRoot().get()`.

```swift
let value = await doc.getRoot().get("key") as? String
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document.

```swift
await doc.eventStream.sink { event in
    switch event {
    case let event as LocalChangeEvent:
        print(event)
    case let event as RemoteChangeEvent:
        for changeInfo in event.value {
            print(changeInfo.change.message)
            for path in changeInfo.paths {
                if path.starts(with: "$.obj.num") {
                    // root.obj.num is changed
                } else if path.starts(with: "$.obj") {
                    // root.obj is changed
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of other peers

Other peers' activities can be accessed by subscribing to the client.

```swift
client.eventStream.sink { event in
    switch event {
    case let event as PeerChangedEvent:
        print("#### c1 \(event)")
    default:
        break
    }
}.store(in: &self.cancellables)
```

Next, let's take a look at the [iOS SDK](/docs/ios-sdk).
