## Getting Started with Android SDK

Welcome to Yorkie Android SDK! In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to get started with the Android SDK.

### Using in your projects

The library is published to [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/dev/yorkie/yorkie-android/), so you can simply add the following line to your dependencies.

#### Gradle

To use the Yorkie Android SDK in your project, you will need to add it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file.

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("dev.yorkie:yorkie-android:{{YORKIE_ANDROID_VERSION}}")
}
```

Make sure to replace `dev.yorkie` and `{{YORKIE_ANDROID_VERSION}}` with the correct group ID and version number for the Yorkie SDK.

#### Maven
Add a dependency to the `<dependencies>` element.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.yorkie</groupId>
  <artifactId>yorkie-android</artifactId>
  <version>{{YORKIE_ANDROID_VERSION}}</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

### How to use Yorkie

#### 1. Creating a Client with API key

First, create a Client instance with API key and connect it to the yorkie server.

```kotlin
val client = Client(context, "{{API_HOST}}", {{API_PORT}}, Options(apiKey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"))

// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.activateAsync().await	
}
```

> The API key is used to identify the project in Yorkie. You can get the API key of the project you created in the [Dashboard]({{DASHBOARD_PATH}}).

#### 2. Creating a Document

Then create a Document.

```kotlin
val document = Document(Key("my-doc"))

// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  client.attachAsync(document).await()
}
```

The document should be attached to the client in order to automatically synchronize it between the users participating the document.

#### 3. Updating the Document

The created document is initially an empty object. You can create or update a key-value property you would like to share with peers using `Document.updateAsync()`.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.updateAsync { root ->
    root["key"] = "value" // {"key":"value"}
  }.await()
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Document

If you want to access the document properties, you can use `Document.getRoot()`.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.updateAsync { root ->
    root["sharedMessage"] = "Hello World!" // {"sharedMessage":"Hello World!"}
  }.await()
  println(document.getRoot()["sharedMessage"]) // "Hello World!"
}
```

#### 5. Subscribing to the changes that happen in the Document

Clients sharing the same document can subscribe to the changes that happen in the Document.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.events.collect { event ->
    println("A change event occurred in the Document!")
  }
}
```

You can execute different actions depending on the source of change.
 

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.events.collect { event ->
    if (event is Document.Event.RemoteChange) {
      println("A peer has changed the Document!")
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. Viewing the presence of other peers

You can also subscribe to the presence of users participating in the document using `doc.events.filterIsInstance<PresenceChange>()`. 
You can use `doc.presences` to get the list of users who are currently involved in the document.

```kotlin
// Declare your own CoroutineScope
scope.launch {
  document.filterIsInstance<PresenceChange>.collect {
    val users = document.presences.value
    println("There are currently ${users.length} users online.")
  }
}
```

Next, let's take a look at the [Android SDK](/docs/android-sdk).
