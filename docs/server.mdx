## Server

Server is a typical server. A Server receives changes from Clients, stores them in DB, and propagates them to Clients who subscribe to Documents.

### Getting started

#### Install pre-built binaries

The easiest way to install Yorkie is from pre-built binaries:

1. Download the compressed archive file for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/releases).
2. Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
3. Add the executable binaries to your PATH. For example, rename and/or move the binaries to a directory in your PATH (like /usr/local/bin), or add the directory created from the previous step to your PATH.
4. Test if Yorkie is in your PATH in shell:

```bash
$ yorkie version
Yorkie: {{site.version}}
Commit: ...
Go: ...
Build date: ...
```

#### Install via Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a free and open-source package management system for Mac OS X. Install the official [Yorkie formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yorkie) in Terminal.

To update Yorkie to the latest version, update Homebrew first.

```bash
$ brew update
```

Now, install Yorkie.

```bash
$ brew install yorkie
```

Verify that the installation worked by opening a new Terminal session and trying Yorkie's available subcommands.

```bash
$ yorkie version
Yorkie: {{site.version}}
Commit: ...
Go: ...
Build date: ...
```

#### Commands (CLI)

Yorkie is controlled via a very easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI). Yorkie is just a single command-line application `yorkie`, which takes a subcommand such as `server`.

The Yorkie CLI is a well-behaved command-line application. In erroneous cases, a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to `-h` and `---help` as you'd most likely expect.

To get help for any specific command, pass the `-h` flag to the relevant subcommand. For example, to see help about the `server` subcommand:

```bash
$ yorkie server --help
Start Yorkie server

```

#### Running a Server

Next, let's start a Yorkie Server. The Server handles administrative requests such as project maintenance, and it continues to run until it's told to quit with termination commands such as Ctrl+C.

```bash
$ yorkie server

backend created: id: c6ljcdl94818baveba8g, rpc: localhost:11101: db: memory
serving admin on 11103
serving RPC on 11101
serving profiling on 11102
```

The Server stores its data using an in-memory DB, which does not provide durability by default.

### Running the Server with MongoDB

If you start the Server with a MongoDB address, you can permanently save the data stored by Yorkie.

> To start MongoDB, `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` in [the project root](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie).

Then, start a Yorkie Server with `--mongo-connection-uri` flag to connect the MongoDB.

```bash
$ yorkie server --mongo-connection-uri mongodb://localhost:27017

MongoDB connected, URI: mongodb://localhost:27017, DB: yorkie-meta
backend created: id: c6ljibt948102kkt9neg, rpc: localhost:11101: db: mongodb://localhost:27017
serving profiling on 11102
serving RPC on 11101
```
