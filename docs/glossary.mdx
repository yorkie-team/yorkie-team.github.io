## Glossary

These terms are used in the Yorkie project and community. Understanding them will help you navigate the documentation and discussions more easily.

### Core Architecture

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Yorkie | An open-source document store for building real-time collaborative applications. Sometimes it refers to the [main repository](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie). |
| Client | A regular client that communicates with the Yorkie server, synchronizing document changes for real-time collaboration. |
| Server | The central component that manages documents and channels, stores changes, and facilitates communication between clients. |
| Project | A logical grouping of documents, channels, and clients, allowing multiple independent services within a single Yorkie installation. |

### Document & Data Structures

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Document | The primary data structure in Yorkie for persistent, collaborative data. It contains a presence and a root, and is stored in the database. Documents support offline editing and conflict-free synchronization using CRDTs. |
| Root | The main JSON-like data structure(CRDT) within a document that can be shared and edited by multiple users. |
| Change | A representation of modifications made to a document, created by calling `Document.Update()`. |
| Schema | An optional validation key that can be specified when attaching a document to ensure it conforms to a predefined structure or set of rules. |
| YSON | Yorkie JSON (YSON) is a JSON-like format for representing Yorkie documents, including custom CRDT types such as `Text`, `Tree`, `Counter`, along with specialized types like `Int`, `Long`, `Date`, and `BinData`. Used for document snapshots and serialization. |

### Real-time Collaboration

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Channel | A lightweight, memory-only communication layer for real-time features like presence tracking and message broadcasting. Unlike Documents, Channels do not persist data to the database and are designed for ephemeral data. |
| Broadcast | A messaging mechanism within Channels that allows clients to publish and subscribe to real-time events without persisting the data. Useful for chat messages, notifications, and other ephemeral communications. |
| Presence | A data structure representing a user's current state within a document (e.g., cursor position, selection). |

### Synchronization & State Management

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Sync Mode | The synchronization mode that determines how a document syncs with the server. Options include: `Realtime` (automatic push and pull), `RealtimePushOnly` (push only), `RealtimeSyncOff` (no sync but watch stream active), and `Manual` (requires manual sync calls). |
| Snapshot | A complete state of a document at a specific point in time. When the number of changes exceeds a threshold, the server sends a snapshot instead of individual changes to optimize synchronization performance. |
| Revision | An immutable snapshot of a document at a specific point in time with metadata (label, description, timestamp). Revisions allow users to browse document history, preview previous states, and restore documents to earlier versions. See [Document Revisions](/docs/advanced/revisions). |
| PushPullChanges | An API for bidirectional synchronization of changes between clients and the server. |
| Checkpoint | A mechanism for tracking the synchronization state between clients and the server, consisting of ServerSeq and ClientSeq. |

### CRDT Internals

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CRDT Element | A data structure representing a CRDT element, analogous to an Element in the DOM. For more information, see [Data Structures](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/data-structure.md). |
| CRDT Node | A single node within a CRDT element. |
| Tombstone | A marker for a deleted node or element in CRDT. |
| Garbage Collection | The process of removing nodes marked as tombstones to optimize storage and performance. |

### Server Management

| Word | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Admin API | A REST API that allows server-side applications to programmatically manage Yorkie documents without using the Yorkie SDK. Useful for server-side document management, automation, and integration. |
| Housekeeping | A maintenance process that cleans up unnecessary data on the server. |
