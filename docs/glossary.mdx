| Housekeeping | A maintenance process that cleans up unnecessary data on the server. |
| CRDT Element | A data structure representing a CRDT element, analogous to an Element in the DOM. For more information, see [Data Structures](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/data-structure.md). |
