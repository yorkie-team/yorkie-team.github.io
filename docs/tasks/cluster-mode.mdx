## Cluster Mode

In a production environment, it is generally expected that more than one server handles requests. Even if a Server goes down, the other Servers must be able to handle the request. We can achieve that by setting up Servers with Cluster-Mode.

This page describes how to set up a cluster of Servers. An example of the cluster is as follows:

```
                        ┌───────────┐
                        │  ┌──────┐ │
                      ┌─┼─►│Server│ │    ┌───────┐
                      │ │  └──▲───┘ │ ┌─►│MongoDB│
┌──────┐  ┌────────┐  │ │     │     │ │  └───────┘
│Client├─►│Load    ├──┤ │ Broadcast ├─┤
└──────┘  │Balancer│  │ │ DocEvents │ │  ┌────┐
          └────────┘  │ │     │     │ └─►│etcd│
                      │ │  ┌──▼───┐ │    └────┘
                      └─┼─►│Server│ │
                        │  └──────┘ │
                        └───────────┘
```

- Load Balancer: It is responsible for distributing the load of the requests to the Servers.
- Broadcast Channel: It is responsible for broadcasting the events to all Servers.
- MongoDB: It stores the data of Yorkie.
- etcd: It is used to store the state of the cluster such as MemberMap, SubscriptionMap, etc.

### Cluster Setup

First, we need components such as etcd, MongoDB, and Load Balancer in order to set up the cluster.

Various types of load balancer can be used for the cluster. For CodePair, We have configured the cluster on AWS, so we use [ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) as Load Balancer.

> For testing cluster mode, we can use Docker Compose to run applications such as etcd and MongoDB. To start them, type `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-ci.yml up --build -d` in [the project root](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie).

If etcd and MongoDB are ready, we can run Servers in cluster mode. In the terminal, run the Server with flags for MongoDB and etcd.

```bash
$ yorkie server --mongodb-uri mongodb://localhost:27017 --etcd-endpoints http://localhost:2379

MongoDB connected, URI: mongodb://localhost:27017, DB: yorkie-meta
etcd connected, URI: [http://localhost:2379]
backend created: id: c6n20nnblaroaopqdbp0, rpc: localhost:11101: db: mongodb://localhost:27017
serving profiling on 11102
serving RPC on 11101
```

Open a new terminal and run the Server by using `xxx-port` flags to avoid ports conflicts.

```bash
$ yorkie server --rpc-port 21101 --profiling-port 21102 --mongo-connection-uri mongodb://localhost:27017 --etcd-endpoints http://localhost:2379

MongoDB connected, URI: mongodb://localhost:27017, DB: yorkie-meta
etcd connected, URI: [http://localhost:2379]
backend created: id: c6n25o7blarohq3ve250, rpc: localhost:21101: db: mongodb://localhost:27017
serving profiling on 21102
serving RPC on 21101
```

Now both Servers are ready to receive requests from Clients.
