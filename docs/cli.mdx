## CLI

CLI is a command-line interface for Yorkie. You can use CLI to manage your projects, documents or to start the server.

### Getting started

Let's get started with the CLI. There are two ways to install the CLI: pre-built binaries and Homebrew.

#### Install pre-built binaries

The easiest way to install Yorkie is from pre-built binaries:

1. Download the compressed archive file for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/releases).
2. Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
3. Add the executable binaries to your PATH. For example, rename and/or move the binaries to a directory in your PATH (like /usr/local/bin), or add the directory created from the previous step to your PATH.
4. Test if Yorkie is in your PATH in shell:

```bash
$ yorkie version
Yorkie: {{YORKIE_VERSION}}
Commit: ...
Go: ...
Build date: ...
```

#### Install via Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a free and open-source package management system for Mac OS X. Install the official [Yorkie formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yorkie) in Terminal.

To update Yorkie to the latest version, update Homebrew first.

```bash
$ brew update
```

Now, install Yorkie.

```bash
$ brew install yorkie
```

Verify that the installation worked by opening a new Terminal session and trying Yorkie's available subcommands.

```bash
$ yorkie version
Yorkie: {{YORKIE_VERSION}}
Commit: ...
Go: ...
Build date: ...
```

#### Commands

Yorkie is just a single command-line application `yorkie`, which takes a subcommand such as `server`.

The Yorkie CLI is a well-behaved command-line application. In erroneous cases, a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to `-h` and `---help` as you'd most likely expect.

To get help for any specific command, pass the `-h` flag to the relevant subcommand. For example, to see help about the `server` subcommand:

```bash
$ yorkie server --help
Start Yorkie server

Usage:
  yorkie server [options] [flags]

```

### Project

Project represents your service or application in Yorkie. Separate Projects can exist within a single application. You can add more Projects as needed, for example, if you want to manage [auth webhook](/docs/cli#auth-webhook) and documents for specific purposes.

To manage Projects, you can use the `project` subcommand:

```bash
$ yorkie project
Manage projects

Usage:
  yorkie project [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create a new project
  ls          List all projects
  update      Update a project

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for project

Use "yorkie project [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

#### Listing Projects

You can list Projects on the server using `ls`.

```bash
$ yorkie project ls
 NAME     PUBLIC KEY            SECRET KEY            AUTH WEBHOOK URL  AUTH WEBHOOK METHODS  CLIENT DEACTIVATE THRESHOLD  CREATED AT 
 default  cfurlpq6qdop9v48o0u0  cfurlpq6qdop9v48o0ug                    []                    24h                          15 minutes
```

_Server creates a `default project` automatically. If you create a Client without apiKey, the Client is created in the default Project._

#### Creating a Project

You can create a new Project with a name using `create`.

```bash
$ yorkie project create test-project
{"id":"63fdbebab48d9fd33996b38a","name":"test-project","owner":"","auth_webhook_url":"","auth_webhook_methods":null,"ClientDeactivateThreshold":"24h","public_key":"cfurtei6qdop9v48o0v0","secret_key":"cfurtei6qdop9v48o0vg","created_at":"2023-02-28T08:43:38.192448Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T08:43:38.192448Z"}
```

If you create a Client with `public_key` of the Project as `apiKey`, you can manage the Client in the Project.

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  apiKey: 'cfurtei6qdop9v48o0v0', // public_key of the project
});
```

Then Documents attached to the Client are isolated and stored in the Project.

#### Updating the Project

You can update the Project on the server using `update`.

```
Usage:
  yorkie project update [name] [flags]

Examples:
yorkie project update name [options]

Flags:
      --auth-webhook-url string              authorization-webhook update url
      --client-deactivate-threshold string   client deactivate threshold for housekeeping
  -h, --help                                 help for update
      --name string                          new project name
```

You can update the name of the Project with `--name` flag.

```bash
$ yorkie project update test-project --name new-test-project
{"id":"63fdc721b48d9fd33996b38b","name":"new-test-project","owner":"","auth_webhook_url":"","auth_webhook_methods":null,"ClientDeactivateThreshold":"24h","public_key":"cfuse8a6qdop9v48o100","secret_key":"cfuse8a6qdop9v48o10g","created_at":"2023-02-28T09:19:29.269875Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T09:27:06.0588974Z"}
```

#### Auth Webhook

A webhook is an HTTP POST that is called when something happens. If the Auth Webhook has been configured, when a Server receives a request from a Client, the Server checks if the Client has been authorized for a certain Document by asking an outside service with a REST request.

This page shows how to set up an Auth Webhook. The overall flow is as follows:

```
(5) response the request  (4) handle the request
     ┌─────────────────┐  ┌──┐
     │                 │  │  │   (3) response
     ▼                 │  ▼  │    - allowed
 ┌──────┐             ┌┴─────┤    - reason   ┌──────────────┐
 │Client├────────────►│Server│◄──────────────┤Outside Server│
 └──────┘ (1)request  └────┬─┘               └──────────────┘
           - token         │                      ▲
           - dockey        └──────────────────────┘
                               (2) call webhook
                                - token
                                - dockey
                                - verb: r or rw
```

First, We need to pass some tokens (that identify users in the service) when creating a Client:

```javascript
const client = new yorkie.Client('{{API_ADDR}}', {
  token: SOME_TOKEN,
});
```

This token will be sent to the Server upon every request from the Client.

We can specify an Auth Webhook for the project by update command with the `--auth-webhook-url` flag:

```bash
$ yorkie project update [name] --auth-webhook-url http://localhost:3000/auth-hook
```

The Server who receives the token calls the given webhook URL before processing the requests.

Here is an example of the webhook requests:

```javascript
{
  "token": "SOME_TOKEN",          // token passed by the client
  "method": "PushPull",           // method: ActivateClient, DeactivateClient, AttachDocument, DetachDocument, WatchDocuments
  documentAttributes: [{
    key: "DOCUMENT_KEY",          // document key
    verb: "r"                     // 'r' or 'rw'
  }]
}
```

The outside server should respond like this:

```javascript
{
  "allowed": true, // or false if the given token is not authorized for this document.
  "reason": "ok"   // [optional] reason for this response.
}
```

If the server receives a response with `allowed: true` from the outside server, it handles the request normally, otherwise it sends the `codes.Unauthenticated` error to the client.

#### Client Deactivate Threshold

Client Deactivate Threshold is a time duration that determines the time for client deactivation of documents in projects. Deactivating the client and detaching it from documents is needed to increase the efficiency of GC removing [CRDT tombstones](https://crdt.tech/glossary). For more information about GC, please refer to [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/yorkie-team/yorkie/blob/main/design/garbage-collection.md).

You can set client deactivate threshold of the project with `--client-deactivate-threshold` flag.

```bash
$ yorkie project update test-project --client-deactivate-threshold 1h30m20s
{"id":"63fdc721b48d9fd33996b38b","name":"test-project","owner":"","auth_webhook_url":"","auth_webhook_methods":null,"ClientDeactivateThreshold":"1h30m20s","public_key":"cfuse8a6qdop9v48o100","secret_key":"cfuse8a6qdop9v48o10g","created_at":"2023-02-28T09:19:29.269875Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T09:19:41.7616869Z"}
```

Setting the client deactivation threshold to `1h30m20s` will deactivate clients that have been inactive for 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 20 seconds but still remained activated. This will help document GC by not counting deactivated client's document sequence.
