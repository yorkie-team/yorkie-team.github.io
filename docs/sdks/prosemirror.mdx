## ProseMirror

`@yorkie-js/prosemirror` is a ProseMirror binding for the [Yorkie JS SDK](/docs/sdks/js-sdk) that enables real-time collaborative rich text editing. It integrates Yorkie's CRDT-based document model with ProseMirror's editing framework.

This page is under construction. For now, you can explore the [ProseMirror example](/examples/prosemirror) to see it in action.
